üè¶ The Protocol: The Pools
The POSUM Protocol offers a suite of yield-generating pools, each designed for a different type of user with a different risk appetite.

Positive Pool: The Stable Anchor
The Positive Pool is the safe, simple, and reliable entry point to the POSUM ecosystem.

Vision: To provide sustainable, real yield on blue-chip assets.

Assets: At launch, we will offer two separate vaults: one for USDC and one for WETH.

Deposit Type: Flexible only. Users can withdraw their principal at any time.

Yield Source: Generates real yield by supplying assets to a battle-tested external protocol like Compound V3.

Rewards: Users earn SUM Points (1x multiplier), which will be used for the future $POSUM airdrop.

Degen Pool: The Genesis Farm
The Degen Pool is the ultimate high-risk, high-reward "game" for our most dedicated supporters.

Vision: To be the primary distribution engine for the $POSUM token and to reward the highest-conviction members of the colony.

Asset: ETH only.

Deposit Type: Permanent Lock. The user's principal is sacrificed to the protocol treasury forever.

Launch Mechanic ("The Founder's Week"): For the first week only, there will be a low deposit cap to ensure a fair initial distribution. After the first week, the cap is removed.

Rewards: The pool pays out the real $POSUM token in weekly reward epochs.

Ignition Pool: The Utility Engine
The Ignition Pool is the premier launchpad for new partner projects on Base, and it is the core utility of the $POSUM token.

Vision: To give our community exclusive, early access to the next generation of projects on Base.

Staking Token: $POSUM only.

Reward Token: The partner project's new token.

Purpose: The Ignition Pool gives our most loyal holders a place to put their $POSUM to work, creating a powerful incentive to hold the token long-term.
