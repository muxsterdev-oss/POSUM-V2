üõ°Ô∏è Our Commitment to Security
Security is not a feature; it is the foundation of the POSUM Protocol. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of safety to protect our users and their funds.

Professional Audits
Before our mainnet launch, all of our core smart contracts will undergo a full, professional security audit by a reputable third-party firm. The final audit report will be made public for full transparency. We believe in "don't trust, verify."

Decentralized Treasury (Multisig)
All protocol-owned assets, including the Degen Pool's locked ETH, the Community Treasury's funds, and our Protocol Owned Liquidity, will be controlled by a Gnosis Safe Multisig Wallet. This means that any transaction to move these funds requires the signature of multiple, trusted core team members. This eliminates any single point of failure and ensures that no single person ever has unilateral control over the protocol's assets.

Bug Bounties
Post-launch, we will establish a formal bug bounty program on a platform like Immunefi. We believe that a robust and ongoing bug bounty is the best way to incentivize the world's best security researchers to continuously test our code and keep our protocol safe for the long term.

Open Source & Verified Contracts
All of our smart contracts are and will always be open-source and verified on the Basescan block explorer. We encourage our community members to review our code and hold us to the highest standards of transparency.
