ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the POSUM Protocol
POSUM is a community-first, gamified yield protocol built on Base. Our mission is to create a sustainable, transparent, and engaging ecosystem that rewards users through clear, strategic gameplay.

We are committed to a fair launch, with no venture capitalists or presale, ensuring that the protocol is owned and governed by its community from day one.

What is POSUM?
The POSUM ecosystem is built on a simple but powerful idea: create a perfect, circular economy where every user, from the cautious farmer to the committed degen, works together to build value for the protocol and the $POSUM token.

Our protocol is divided into three core pillars:

The Pools: High-yield staking vaults where users can put their assets to work.

The Forage: A gamified mission system to onboard, educate, and reward new community members.

SUM Points: The "proof-of-loyalty" points that will be used for the main $POSUM airdrop.

This documentation will guide you through every aspect of the protocol, from our tokenomics to the deep mechanics of each pool. Welcome to the colony.
