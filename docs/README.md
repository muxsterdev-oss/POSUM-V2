ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the POSUM Protocol

POSUM is a community-first, gamified yield protocol built on Base. Our mission is to create a sustainable, transparent, and engaging ecosystem where users are rewarded through clear, strategic gameplay.

We are committed to launching fairly and building alongside our community from the very beginning. POSUM is designed to remain open and accessible, while leaving room for future strategic partners who share our vision of sustainable growth.

What is POSUM?

The POSUM ecosystem is built on a simple but powerful idea: create a balanced, circular economy where every participant â€” from cautious farmers to committed degens â€” works together to build value for the protocol and the $POSUM token.

Our protocol rests on three core pillars:

The Pools â†’ High-yield staking vaults powered by integrations like Compound v3.

The Forage â†’ A gamified mission system that onboards, educates, and rewards community members.

SUM Points â†’ Proof-of-loyalty points that track participation and form the basis of the main $POSUM airdrop.

This documentation will guide you through every aspect of the protocol, from tokenomics to the mechanics of each pool. Welcome to the colony.
